# Hand-gesture-controlled-robotic-arm
This project brings the dream of intuitive robot control through natural hand gestures closer to 
reality. An Arduino Nano and commonly available sensors are used to construct a robotic arm 
controlled by hand gestures. Imagine controlling the robot by mimicking your hand 
movements: a closed fist for gripping, tilting your hand for base rotation, or even using specific 
finger bends for predefined actions. This project offers more than just the excitement of 
building a robot. By utilizing an MPU6050 sensor for precise tilt detection and flex sensors to 
capture finger bends, the project delves into the fascinating world of parameter tuning. Sensor 
calibration is explored to eliminate bias, noise is filtered out for smoother data, and gesture 
thresholds are defined for accurate recognition. Through meticulous mapping and scaling, 
hand gestures are translated into specific servo motor movements, bringing the robotic arm to 
life. The focus then shifts to fine-tuning the integration time, balancing responsiveness with 
noise reduction. This project transcends the mere construction of a machine; it fosters a deeper 
understanding of gesture-based control by building a bridge between humans and machines, 
unlocking a world of future possibilities
